While the origins of the language are unknown, it is mentioned in at least two documents from the nineteenth century, suggesting that it has existed for more than 100 years. \nThe following rules are used to translate English into Pig Latin: \n• If the word begins with a consonant (including y), then all letters at the beginning of the word, up to the first vowel (excluding y), are removed and then added to the end of the word, followed by ay. For example, computer becomes omputercay and think becomes inkthay.\n• If the word begins with a vowel (not including y), then way is added to the end of the word. For example, algorithm becomes algorithmway and office becomes officeway.\nWrite a program that reads a line of text from the user.
