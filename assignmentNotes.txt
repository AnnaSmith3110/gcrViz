TODO: 
1. store user profile info in json
2. course with most assignments, least assignment

DONE:
1.when running in christ acc, i get axios error 431 -> hence limited to top 10 courses(in most recent order)
2.created new route for displaying details info about assignments like title etc (in show missing assignments analytis section)
3.created two pages -> overall stats and course wise stats 
4.automatically rerouted to /student or /teacher route based on the google account
5.automatically redirect to respective streamlit dashboards based on role(mentioned in 4)
6th oct
6.made missing and late table from dropdown
7.changed course wise submission status to no of submissions per course
8. assignment submissions time patters 
9. avg assignments per week -> not getting correct start and end date


LATER:
1. connect to database
CALC AVG GRADE:
1. check if key exists -> get the assignedGrade from submission_data  
2. check if key exists -> get the maxPoints from submission_metadata 
3. map both by using course_id, however, this might cause a conflict: # Create a dictionary to map course IDs to course names
course_id_to_name = {course['id']: course['name'] for course in course_data}
